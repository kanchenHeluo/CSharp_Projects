            This attribute is used by FxCopBid rule to mark methods that accept format string and list of arguments that match it
            FxCopBid rule uses this attribute to check if the method needs to be included in checks and to read type mappings
            between the argument type to printf Type spec.
            
            If you need to rename/remove the attribute or change its properties, make sure to update the FxCopBid rule!

            <summary>
            if Enabled is true, FxCopBid rule will validate all calls to this method and require that it will have string argument;
            otherwise, this method is ignored.

        <member name="T:BidArgumentTypeAttribute">
            <summary>
            This attribute is used by FxCopBid rule to tell FXCOP the 'real' type sent to the native trace call for this argument. For
            example, if Bid.Trace accepts enumeration value, but marshals it as string to the native trace method, set this attribute
            on the argument and set ArgumentType = typeof(string)
            
            It can be applied on a parameter, to let FxCopBid rule know the format spec type used for the argument, or it can be applied on a method,
            to insert additional format spec arguments at specific location.
            
            If you need to rename/remove the attribute or change its properties, make sure to update the FxCopBid rule!
